Interfacing Diagram Of The Relay Module With The Raspberry Pi GPIO

As you know that Raspberry Pi only generates 3.3v on GPIO pins, this means that you may not be able to power a 5v relay module using Raspberry Pi. The solution on this issue is the use of level converters, these level converters are nothing but MOSFETs that convert low-level signals 3.3V to 5V signals.

The following image shows interfacing of the relay module with the raspberry pi.
