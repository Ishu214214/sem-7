1) Object: Write a program to turn on LED. Also provide blinking of LED by interfacing between raspberry pi and LED.

import time

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO              ## Import GPIO library

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)      ## Use board pin numbering

GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.OUT)          ## Setup GPIO Pin 11 to OUT

while True:
