Project Title: AI-Powered Game Controller and Interaction System

Description:
I spearheaded the development of an innovative AI-powered game controller and interaction system, leveraging computer vision, speech recognition, and automation technologies. The primary objective was to create a seamless and immersive gaming experience by allowing users to control and interact with games using natural gestures and voice commands.

Key Features:

Gesture-based Controls: Integrated Mediapipe's pose detection for real-time recognition of users' hand gestures, translating them into in-game actions.

Voice Commands: Implemented robust speech recognition capabilities, enabling players to issue commands and control game dynamics using their voice.

Automated Gameplay: Leveraged PyAutoGUI for precise automation of mouse and keyboard actions, enhancing gameplay responsiveness and control.

Chatbot Integration: Developed a chatbot companion using NLTK for dynamic interactions, providing players with tips, jokes, and assistance during gameplay.

Immersive Gaming: Successfully applied the system to play online games, showcasing its potential to redefine the gaming experience through intelligent human-computer interaction.


Technologies Used:

Python
OpenCV
Mediapipe
SpeechRecognition
PyAutoGUI
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
Threading for multitasking


Gaming Experience:
This project represents a pioneering approach to gaming interaction. By fusing cutting-edge technologies, it brings a new level of immersion to gameplay, breaking traditional input barriers and offering players an exciting and hands-free gaming experience.

Learning Highlights:
The project enriched my understanding of computer vision, natural language processing, and automation within the context of gaming. It involved creative problem-solving, algorithmic design, and collaboration with diverse libraries, resulting in a project that aligns with the evolving landscape of interactive gaming.
